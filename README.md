- 👋 Hi, I’m @sandlexofficial
- 👀 I’m interested in coding with python, java(game creation and plugins creation for minecraft), and some unity game creation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Java
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment.
- 📫 How to reach me if i were in space: launch a bean can with a string up in space and boom!, there you go, communication!
